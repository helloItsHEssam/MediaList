# Repository

## Description
The **"Repository"** section is created for communication with the **"Data"** layer, and the **"Data"** layer needs to implement these protocols for use by the **"Domain"** layer.

In this section, there are two protocols: **"ImageRepository"** and **"MediaRepository"** which are described in detail in the **"Data"** section. For more information on these protocols and their functions, please refer to the provided link.
