# Entities

## Description
In the **"Entities"** section, we have all the data models required for storing information. It includes three models:

- **"Media"**: This model contains all the necessary information for an image, and it includes a **"description"** field that provides details about the download link's format.

- **"MediaType"**: In this model, you can find information about the type of media, whether it's an image or a video.

- **"PreviewMediaSize"**: This model holds information related to the preview image size. It determines the orientation based on the provided information and creates an appropriate size based on the screen's width and height.

So, in summary, the **"Entities"** section contains these three data models: "Media" for image information, "MediaType" for media type, and "PreviewMediaSize" for preview image size.
